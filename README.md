# Bloom and Learn - HCI Project

## Project Overview

### Scenario and Context
Our project, **Bloom and Learn**, is inspired by Sarah, a determined 13-year-old who, like many other girls in her community, faces challenges attending school due to the lack of menstrual hygiene resources. The issue not only disrupts her education but also creates stigma and barriers to her personal growth. Recognizing these struggles, our project aims to connect compassionate donors with school administrators and community leaders to address this pressing need.

Through this platform, we aim to:
- **Provide Access to Sanitary Products:** Ensuring girls have access to sanitary towels.
- **Promote Girls’ Education:** Empowering young girls to pursue their education without interruption.
- **Foster Community Support:** Uniting donors and administrators to facilitate impactful, dignity-driven assistance.

### Proposed Solution
Our application bridges the gap between donors, school administrators, and marginalized girls. By leveraging technology, it enables efficient donation management and ensures that girls like Sarah have the resources to remain in school and pursue their dreams.
